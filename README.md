# Ketch
Ketch is an iOS mobile app designed to facilitate transactions between two local parties for trading goods and services. It will utilize geolocation to create a local market derived from nearby users and allow them to buy and sell goods in a local marketplace. The program will emphasize security foremost, forcing the users to validate their identity, provide a secure transaction system, user reviews, and a safe meeting space for the actual transaction. The end result will be a more secure, safer way to buy and sell goods with far less fraudulent transactions occurring to the users.
